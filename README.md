# DITRAS

DITRAS (DIary-based TRAjectory Simulator) is a framework to simulate the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility in a realistic way. DITRAS operates in two steps: the generation of a mobility diary and the translation of the mobility diary into a mobility trajectory. The mobility diary is constructed by a Markov model which captures the tendency of individuals to follow or break their routine. The mobility trajectory is produced by a model based on the concept of preferential exploration and preferential return. DITRAS can reproduce the statistical properties of real human mobility trajectories in an accurate way.
